Basic reading (SELECT)

To get all rows and all columns from a table, use:
    SELECT * FROM items;

To get specific columns from a table, use:
    SELECT name, price FROM items;

To rename columns in the result, use:
    SELECT name AS item_name, price AS item_price FROM items;


To remove duplicates in the result, use:
    SELECT DISTINCT category FROM items;


Filtering rows (WHERE)

To get rows that match a condition, use:
    SELECT * FROM items WHERE id = 5;


To get rows where a value is greater/less than, use:
    SELECT * FROM items WHERE price > 100;


To filter by multiple conditions (both must be true), use:
    SELECT * FROM items WHERE category = 'Food' AND price < 50;


To filter by multiple conditions (either can be true), use:
    SELECT * FROM items WHERE category = 'Food' OR category = 'Drinks';


To exclude something, use:
    SELECT * FROM items WHERE category != 'Food';


To match one of many values, use:
    SELECT * FROM items WHERE category IN ('Food', 'Drinks', 'Tech');


To check a range, use:
    SELECT * FROM items WHERE price BETWEEN 10 AND 50;


To search text patterns, use:
    SELECT * FROM items WHERE name LIKE '%apple%';


To find rows where a column is empty (NULL), use:
    SELECT * FROM items WHERE description IS NULL;


To find rows where a column is NOT empty, use:
    SELECT * FROM items WHERE description IS NOT NULL;


Sorting and limiting results

To sort results ascending, use:
    SELECT * FROM items ORDER BY price ASC;


To sort results descending, use:
    SELECT * FROM items ORDER BY price DESC;


To get only the first N rows, use:
    SELECT * FROM items LIMIT 10;


To skip some rows and then take N rows, use (pagination):
    SELECT * FROM items LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20;


Aggregation (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX)

To count how many rows are in a table, use:
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_items FROM items;


To sum a column, use:
    SELECT SUM(price) AS total_price FROM items;


To get average/min/max, use:
    SELECT AVG(price) AS avg_price, MIN(price) AS min_price, MAX(price) AS max_price
    FROM items;



Grouping (GROUP BY + HAVING)

To group rows and get counts per group, use:
    SELECT category, COUNT(*) AS count FROM items GROUP BY category;


To filter grouped results (HAVING is for groups), use:
    SELECT category, COUNT(*) AS count FROM items GROUP BY category HAVING COUNT(*) > 3;



Joining tables (relationships)

Assume:
users(id, name)
orders(id, user_id, total)

To combine matching rows from both tables (INNER JOIN), use:
    SELECT users.name, orders.total FROM users INNER JOIN orders ON orders.user_id = users.id;


To get all users even if they have no orders (LEFT JOIN), use:
    SELECT users.name, orders.total FROM users LEFT JOIN orders ON orders.user_id = users.id;


To get rows where a left join didn’t match (find “missing” relations), use:
    SELECT users.* FROM users LEFT JOIN orders ON orders.user_id = users.id WHERE orders.id IS NULL;


Insert data (INSERT)

To add a new row, use:
    INSERT INTO items (name, price, category) VALUES ('Apple', 10, 'Food');


To add multiple rows at once, use:
    INSERT INTO items (name, price, category) VALUES ('Apple', 10, 'Food'), ('Milk', 25, 'Drinks');

================================
Update data (UPDATE)
================================

To update a value in rows that match a condition, use:
    UPDATE items SET price = 15 WHERE id = 1;


To update multiple columns, use:
    UPDATE items SET price = 15, category = 'Fruit' WHERE id = 1;
⚠️ If you run UPDATE items SET price = 15; with no WHERE, it updates everything.

===============================
Delete data (DELETE)
===============================

To delete a row that matches a condition, use:
    DELETE FROM items WHERE id = 1;


To delete all rows in a table, use:
    DELETE FROM items;


===============================
Create and modify tables (DDL)
===============================

To create a new table, use:
CREATE TABLE items (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  price REAL NOT NULL,
  category TEXT
);


To add a new column, use:
    ALTER TABLE items ADD COLUMN created_at TEXT;


To delete a table completely, use:
    DROP TABLE items;

===============================
Constraints, indexes, and safety
===============================

To prevent duplicates in a column, use UNIQUE:
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL
);


To speed up searching on a column, create an index:
    CREATE INDEX idx_items_category ON items(category);

===============================
Useful “real world” patterns
===============================

To get the newest rows (by date), use:
    SELECT * FROM items ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;


To check if something exists, use:
    SELECT 1 FROM items WHERE name = 'Apple' LIMIT 1;


To “search” multiple fields, use:
    SELECT * FROM items WHERE name LIKE '%app%' OR category LIKE '%app%';
