1. Browser Initialization
  - It stores
    - A registry of available websites {k: v}
    - Navigation history
    - Current active page

2. Website Registration
    - each website that wants to be accessible, calls registerWebsite(url, page, title)
    - the browser stores this in its website registry
    - no navigation happens at this stage

3. User Input - URL bar
    - User types text into the url Input,
    - When enter is pressed:
        - the input is normalized (adds mmm. if missing)
        - browser checks if url exists in the registry

4. Navigation decision
    - If the url exists: 
        - navigate to the registered page   
        - update the page title (if provided)
        - add url to navigation history
    - if the url does not exists
        - navigate to a 404 page
        - still record the attempted url in history

5. Search box behavior
    - As the user types:
        - browser filters registered website urls based on characters being typed
        and shows suggestions
    - clicking the suggestion:
        - triggers normal navigation to url.

6. history tracking
    - each succesful navigation pushes url to recentlyVisited set (to avoid duplicates)
    - this set will be used to suggest recent sites and simulate browser history

7. rendering
    - browser renders:
        url search bar, search suggestion, active pages.

## also thinking to scale later, we could add tabs logic where clicking add tab pushes a new tab
    to an object of tabs with unique keys or a list.
